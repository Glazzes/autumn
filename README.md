## Autumn DI container

### About this project
Spring boot is by far the most used JVM web framework used today and
something that caught my eye was the dependency injection
container and how it "magically" injects the right instances 
into your classes

The main goal of this project is to get a decent understanding
of how java.lang.reflect package can be used to manipulate bytecode
at execution time to create new libraries.

### Features
* Field based injection
* Constructor based injection 
* Circular dependency detection
